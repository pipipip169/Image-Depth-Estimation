# Depth Information Analysis from Stereo Images

This project focuses on **Stereo Matching**, a critical task in the field of **Computer Vision**. The primary goal is to recover 3D information from a real-world scene using a pair of 2D stereo images. Stereo Matching is widely applied in fields such as **Autonomous Driving** and **Augmented Reality (AR)**.

## 1. Introduction

Stereo Matching refers to the problem of computing the disparity (depth) map from two stereo images. A **disparity map** shows the difference in the position of the same object viewed in two different images, which helps infer the depth information of the scene.

- Disparity Map (Depth Map)

Using the disparity map, we can calculate the **Depth Information** of the objects in the scene.

## 2. Project Tasks

In this project, you will explore the **Stereo Matching** algorithm by developing and testing multiple techniques to compute the disparity map from a stereo image pair.

### Stereo Image Datasets:

- **Tsukuba Image Dataset**: Used for Problem 1. You can download the Tsukuba dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14gf8bcym_lTcvjZQmg8kwq3aXkENBxMQ/view).
